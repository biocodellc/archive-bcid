#Information about user accounts

== Introduction ==

User accounts are not required to lookup/resolve BCIDs.  However, they are required to work with projects, expeditions, or create new BCIDs.  Here we describe how to obtain a user account for BCIDs.

== User Accounts ==

User accounts can be created by either by the BCID owner or by project administrators. Project administrators can add any existing user in the BCID system as an authorized expedition creator.  Talk to your project administrator to be added to a particular project.

== Project Administrators ==

Project administrators are set by the BCID owner upon request.  There is only one designated project administrator per project.  The project administrator can add, create, and remove users, set the location of the validation XML file, and define the project abstract.

== BCID Owner ==

The BCID owner is the person defined as the "owner" of the BCID project, found on the [http://code.google.com/p/bcid BCID homepage].
