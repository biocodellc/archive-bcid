<h1>BiSciCol</h1>
BiSciCol (Biological Science Collections) is an NSF-funded collaborative project with the goal of building an
infrastructure designed to tag and track scientific collections and all of their derivatives.

<h2>BiSciCol Tools</h2>
The following tools from the BiSciCol project are made available to the biodiversity informatics user community to
promote
linking collections-based data and are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied.
BiSciCol tools use a set of common standards-based <a href="terms/index.html">terms</a> for describing relationships and concepts.
Questions regarding these tools may be directed to the owners and commmitters of the code-base related to each project below.

<ul>
<li>Biocode Commons Identifiers (<a href="/bcid/index.jsp">BCID</a>) provides tools for creating
    identifiers. These identifiers are useful both globally and
    locally, for individuals and organizations, and will satisfy the most demanding requirements related to resolution
    and persistance.

<li>The <a href="/triplifier">Triplifier</a> converts Spreadsheets, databases, and Darwin Core
    Archives into RDF/N3 files suitable for use on the Semantic Web.</li>

<li><a href="/biocode-fims">Biocode FIMS</a> incorporates components of the BCID and triplifier technologies to
    publish sample-based
    spreadsheet data.  Biocode FIMS uses XML configuration files to define validation rules, mapping components for conversion
    to RDF triples, and custom built SPARQL endpoints.</li>

</ul>
<!-- <p>The <a href="/biscicol">BiSciCol</a> application lets users visualize graph connections of
    instances (Identifiers) contained in BiSciCol.</p> -->

<p>

<h2>REST APIs</h2>

<p>We maintain an API for each component of our suite of applications, which are described in detail at the following
    locations:
<ul>
    <li><a href="/id/bcid.wadl">BCID REST Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/triplifier/rest/triplifier.wadl">Triplifier REST Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/biocode-fims/query/biocode-fims.wadl">Biocode FIMS REST Services</a></li>
</ul>

<p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p><a href="http://biscicol.blogspot.com/">The BiSciCol Blog</a> contains updates and current information for the
    BiSciCol
    Project including presentations, news items, and general project information.</p>

<p>All code for the BiSciCol applications are open source and available for use by the community at large and are
    available at:
