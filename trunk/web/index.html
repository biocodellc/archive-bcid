<h1>BiSciCol</h1>
BiSciCol (Biological Science Collections) Tracker is a funded NSF collaborative project with the goal of building an
infrastructure designed to tag and track scientific collections and all of their derivatives.

<h2>BiSciCol Tools</h2>
All of the BiSciCol tools are in active development which means that until mid-way through 2013, you will expect to
see certain broken links and perhaps not complete functionality. We have posted these tools here and make them available
during our development process so we can get feedback from the community and our testers.

<p><a href="/bcid/index.jsp">BCID</a> provides identifier tools to create awesome
    identifiers. These identifiers are useful both globally and
    locally, for individuals and organizations, and will satisfy the most demanding requirements related to resolution
    and persistance. Developers view the online <a href="/bcid/javadoc/index.html">Javadocs</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/triplifier">Triplifier</a> converts Spreadsheets, databases, and Darwin Core
    Archives into RDF/N3 files suitable for use in the Semantic Web and ingestion into the BiSciCol system.</p>

<p>The <a href="/biscicol">BiSciCol</a> application lets users visualize graph connections of
    instances (Identifiers) contained in BiSciCol.</p>

<p><a href="terms/index.html">BiSciCol Terms</a> describe how BiSciCol handles relations between Instances.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p><a href="http://biscicol.blogspot.com/">The BiSciCol Blog</a> contains updates and current information for the
    BiSciCol
    Project including presentations, news items, and general project information.</p>

<p>All code for the BiSciCol applications are open source and available for use by the community at large and are available at:
    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/triplifier/">Triplifier codebase </a></li>
    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/biscicol/">BiSciCol/Viewer codebase</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/bcid/">BCID, Biocode Commons Identifiers</a></li>

<p>REST API
    <br>We maintain an API for each component of our suite of applications. More information on the REST services are
