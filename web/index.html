<h1>BiSciCol</h1>
BiSciCol (Biological Science Collections) is an NSF-funded collaborative project with the goal of building an
infrastructure designed to tag and track scientific collections and all of their derivatives.

<h2>BiSciCol Tools</h2>
The following tools from the BiSciCol project are made available to the biodiversity informatics user community to
promote
linking collections-based data and are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied.
Questions
regarding these tools may be directed to the owners and commmitters of the code-base related to each project below.

<p>Biocode Commons Identifiers, or "<b></b><a href="/bcid/index.jsp">BCID</a></b>" provides tools for creating
    identifiers. These identifiers are useful both globally and
    locally, for individuals and organizations, and will satisfy the most demanding requirements related to resolution
    and persistance. Developers can view the online <a href="/bcid/javadoc/index.html">Javadocs</a>.</p>

<p>The <b></b><a href="/triplifier">Triplifier</a></b> converts Spreadsheets, databases, and Darwin Core
    Archives into RDF/N3 files suitable for use in the Semantic Web and ingestion into the BiSciCol system.</p>

<p><b><a href="/biocode-fims">Biocode FIMS</a></b> incorporates components of the BCID and triplifier technologies to
    publish sample-based
    spreadsheet data to an online graph-based database.</p>

<!-- <p>The <a href="/biscicol">BiSciCol</a> application lets users visualize graph connections of
    instances (Identifiers) contained in BiSciCol.</p> -->

<p>BiSciCol uses <b><a href="terms/index.html">a set of terms</a></b> for describing relationships and concepts.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p><a href="http://biscicol.blogspot.com/">The BiSciCol Blog</a> contains updates and current information for the
    BiSciCol
    Project including presentations, news items, and general project information.</p>

<p>All code for the BiSciCol applications are open source and available for use by the community at large and are
    available at:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/triplifier/">Triplifier codebase </a></li>
    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/bcid/">BCID codebase</a></li>

<h2>REST APIs</h2>

<p>We maintain an API for each component of our suite of applications, which are described in detail at the following
    locations:
<ul>
