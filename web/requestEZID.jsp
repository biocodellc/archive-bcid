       All data group identifiers will be registered as EZIDs free of charge.  Data elements exist within
       the context of BCID only, and can be resolved through EZID using their suffix Passthrough feature free of charge
         as well.  If you wish to retain ownership of data groups or register data elements through the EZID system it is easy
         to transfer rights to your organization.  Please talk to us to arrange the details of this transfer when you are
         ready to do this.
